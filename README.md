# Peet's num radio

This is a python music player remote control created to build small raspberry pi (or other) based MP3 player that doesn't really have a screen and only a numpad as a keyboard. It can control a Moc Player but the goal is to be able control a few main stream server based music players. (mpd, etc.).
